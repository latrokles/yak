yak is a stack based concatenative language loosely based on early implementation of factor.


## running

- `yak` will launch a graphics capable version of yak.
- `yak-cli` will launch a console only version of yak, this is useful for running in systems without a desktop environment.

both of these commands take the same command line arguments.

```
--script FILEPATH	run a specific yak script.
--image  FILEPATH	start yak off a specific image file.
--port   PORT		the port for the interactive server to run in.
```
