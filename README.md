This repository contains software I've written to:

- learn some concept.
- scratch a personal itch.
- have fun.

The code in here may be:

- non-exhaustive.
- overly simplistic (tho not necessarily simple).
- naive.
- inefficient (oh so very inefficient).
- inconsistent.
- possibly incorrect.
- thoroughly untested.
- incomplete.
- in various degrees of broken-ness.

## setting up

these are notes for myself.

- clone this repo.
- install with `pip install -e` (use virtual envs)
- run examples with `yak-examples`
